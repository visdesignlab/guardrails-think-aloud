# Introduction

Welcome to our study.

You will be shown a series of 10 data visualizations accompanied by short captions.
Your task is to answer a short question about each visualization, indicating your opinion on how effective they are. For some of these, you will be asked to think-aloud, verbally explaining your thought process while answering questions.
