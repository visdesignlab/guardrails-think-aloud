## Scenario description 

Please read the scenario description below carefully, as it explains the setting for the visualizations you will see.
If you need to refer to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help in the top right corner of the visualization.

**Scenario**: You would like to invest in *industry funds* but are not sure which is best. 
An industry fund is composed of all individual stocks pertaining to that industry (e.g., a Pharma fund is composed of Pharma A, Pharma B, and Pharma C stocks).
Since you are not familiar with the current market, you turn to social media to read what people shared about recent stock performance.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will see a set of visualizations that show performance of different stocks from a variety of industries. Based on each visualization, you will be asked **how much you trust the visualization and caption**.
