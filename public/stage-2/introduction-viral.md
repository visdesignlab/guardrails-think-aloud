## Celestial Sniffles Scenario Description

Please read the scenario description below carefully, as it explains the setting for the visualizations you will see.
If you need to refer to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help in the top right corner of the visualization.

**Background**: You live in a fantasy world that consists of your home country, as well as other
15 countries located across 5 continents: Eldoril, Thundoril, Aerion, Silvoria, and Mystara. 
Countries within each continent are similar to each other in size and demographics. 

**Scenario**: Thereâ€™s a new viral disease called *Celestial Sniffles*. 
Most countries in the world have adopted one of 3 major disease containment policies: A, B, or C.
Luckily, your country has not been affected yet, but will soon vote on which policy to adopt.

Since you are not familiar with the disease trends or containment policies, you turn to social media to read what people shared about recent infection rates.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will see a set of visualizations that show infection rates in different countries that adopted
one of the containment policies A, B, or C. Based on each visualization, you will be asked to explain whether or not you trust the visualization and caption.
